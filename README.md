# AMAZON WEB SCRAPING

Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed. If you've ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.

Ever taught of buying a product from Amazon with a prediction that the price would go down? In this project, I would iterate over the entire scope of the data wrangling process - gathering data from Amazon website, assessing the data both visually and programmatically, and finally cleaning the data set for tidiness and quality issues to make it suitable for predictive analysis for the Redmi Note 11 pro.

#### AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT


- To collect data from Amazon (Price of Redmi Note 11 pro)

- Data collection for market research: Web-based data extraction services help to monitor the situation which affects the price of the Redmi Note 11 pro for the next 3 months within an interval of one day

- Tracking prices in different stores: This project is also keen to track price from different store. For example, tracking the price of the Redmi Note 11 pro for the period of one month from different store.

- Data assessing 
- Data cleaning 

#### DATA GATHERING 

In this phase data used for this project was gotten from the Amazon Website as this involves a predictive analysis of the price of the Redmi Note 11 pro.

#### DATA ASSESSING 

For this phase, I had to look at the three datasets both visually and programmatically to be able to notice and assess any possible quality or tidiness issue in the datasets.

#### DATA CLEANING 

Data cleaning basically involves tackling the quality and tidiness issues that were note in the previous phase - Data assessing. With the use of formulas, functions and loops, most of the issues were cleaned. 

### HOW THE PROJECT WORKS

This project is based on the price of Redmi Note 11 Pro. Ever taught of buying the Redmi Note 11 pro but not at the current price and you make a predictive analysis that the price would go down?

This projects creates an Excel file in your local machine where it updates the price of the Redmi Note 11 pro over a period of time within an hour.

This projects goes to the Amazon page and returns the price of the Redmi Note 11 pro for as much as you want it within an interval of one day (24 hours) as long as your machine is connected to the internet. it does this by updating the price automatically on your local machine.
### Programming Language Used

Python
## conclusion

Amazon Web Scraping for Redmi Note 10 Pro defines the act  of predictive analysis using python to determine the price of the product over a considerable period of time
